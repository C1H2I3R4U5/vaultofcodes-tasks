
I found some couple of errors,they are :

In you code for loop, you are iterating from 0 to numbers.length, which will cause an "ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException" because array indices are zero-based, and the last valid index in the numbers array is 4 (for a 5-element array). 

Error:  i <= numbers.length.

To fix this, you should change the loop condition to i < numbers.length instead of i <= numbers.length.

Corrected Code:

\\Program to demonstrate Arrays manuplation\\
import java.util.Arrays;
public class ArrayManipulation {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        
        for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
            System.out.println(numbers[i]);
        }
    }
}
